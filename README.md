Hi, I'm @renduh

I work for a company so most of my repos are private but I've got a few little snippets and silly games public.

A lot of my projects for work are longform journalist projects like these:
- https://walescovidvictims.walesonline.co.uk/
- https://reboot.mirror.co.uk/
- https://damned.mirror.co.uk/
- https://www.wiganpierproject.com/
- https://footballproject.live/

But I also make lots of tools that you could describe as Canvas for news.

I write quite a lot of Python too because I'm always tinkering with Raspberry Pi project and am studying for a Physics degree with the Open University.

You can usually find me on twitter https://twitter.com/renduh
